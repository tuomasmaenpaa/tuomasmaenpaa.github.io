  For my Master's thesis, I developed a machine learning based predictive model that predicts goal-scoring in ice hockey based on player positioning.
  The model not only predicts if a goal is likely within the next 5 seconds but it also predicts where the attacking team should move the puck to maximize their
  goal-scoring potential.
  The video below demonstrates how the model works in a direct attacking play. Red color indicates an elevated scoring potential for that location.
